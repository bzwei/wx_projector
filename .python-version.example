# Example .python-version file
# This file is used by pyenv and uv to select the Python version
#
# The project requires Python >=3.12 (see pyproject.toml)
# You can use any version 3.12 or higher (3.12, 3.13, etc.)
#
# To use this:
# 1. Copy this file to .python-version (without .example)
# 2. Change the version to match what you have installed
# 3. The .python-version file is gitignored, so it won't conflict across machines

3.12
