Clap your hands, all you nations;  shout to God with cries of joy. 
How awesome is the Lord Most High,  the great King over all the earth! 
He subdued nations under us,  peoples under our feet. 
He chose our inheritance for us,  the pride of Jacob, whom he loved. 
God has ascended amid shouts of joy,  the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets. 
Sing praises to God, sing praises;  sing praises to our King, sing praises. 
For God is the King of all the earth;  sing to him a psalm of praise. 
God reigns over the nations;  God is seated on his holy throne. 
The nobles of the nations assemble  as the people of the God of Abraham,  for the kings of the earth belong to God;  he is greatly exalted.
