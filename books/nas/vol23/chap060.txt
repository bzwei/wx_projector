"No longer will you have the sun for light by day, Nor for brightness will the moon give you light; But you will have the Lord for an everlasting light, And your God for your glory.
"Your sun will set no more, Neither will your moon wane; For you will have the Lord for an everlasting light, And the days of your mourning will be finished.
"Then all your people [will be] righteous; They will possess the land forever, The branch of My planting, The work of My hands, That I may be glorified.
"The smallest one will become a clan, And the least one a mighty nation. I, the Lord, will hasten it in its time."
