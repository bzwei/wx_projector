O Lord, Thou art my God; I will exalt Thee, I will give thanks to Thy name; For Thou hast worked wonders, Plans [formed] long ago, with perfect faithfulness.
For Thou hast made a city into a heap, A fortified city into a ruin; A palace of strangers is a city no more, It will never be rebuilt.
Therefore a strong people will glorify Thee; Cities of ruthless nations will revere Thee.
For Thou hast been a defense for the helpless, A defense for the needy in his distress, A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat; For the breath of the ruthless Is like a [rain] storm [against] a wall.
Like heat in drought, Thou dost subdue the uproar of aliens; [Like] heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is silenced.
And the Lord of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain; A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow, [And] refined, aged wine.
And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples, Even the veil which is stretched over all nations.
He will swallow up death for all time, And the Lord God will wipe tears away from all faces, And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth; For the Lord has spoken.
And it will be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the Lord for whom we have waited; Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation."
For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain, And Moab will be trodden down in his place As straw is trodden down in the water of a manure pile.
And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it As a swimmer spreads out [his hands] to swim, But [the Lord] will lay low his pride together with the trickery of his hands.
And the unassailable fortifications of your walls He will bring down, Lay low, [and] cast to the ground, even to the dust.
