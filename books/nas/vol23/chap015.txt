The oracle concerning Moab. Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated [and] ruined; Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated [and] ruined.
They have gone up to the temple and [to] Dibon, [even] to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone's head is bald [and] every beard is cut off.
In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; On their housetops and in their squares Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.
Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out, Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz; Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; His soul trembles within him.
My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are as far as Zoar [and] Eglath-shelishiyah, For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping; Surely on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over [their] ruin.
For the waters of Nimrim are desolate. Surely the grass is withered, the tender grass died out, There is no green thing.
Therefore the abundance [which] they have acquired and stored up They carry off over the brook of Arabim.
For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab, Its wail [goes] as far as Eglaim and its wailing even to Beer-elim.
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; Surely I will bring added [woes] upon Dimon, A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
