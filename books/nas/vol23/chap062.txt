For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not keep quiet, Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness, And her salvation like a torch that is burning.
And the nations will see your righteousness, And all kings your glory; And you will be called by a new name, Which the mouth of the Lord will designate.
You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, And a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
It will no longer be said to you, "Forsaken," Nor to your land will it any longer be said, "Desolate"; But you will be called, "My delight is in her," And your land, "Married"; For the Lord delights in you, And [to Him] your land will be married.
For [as] a young man marries a virgin, [So] your sons will marry you; And [as] the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, [So] your God will rejoice over you.
On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; All day and all night they will never keep silent. You who remind the Lord, take no rest for yourselves;
And give Him no rest until He establishes And makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by His strong arm, "I will never again give your grain [as] food for your enemies; Nor will foreigners drink your new wine, for which you have labored."
But those who garner it will eat it, and praise the Lord; And those who gather it will drink it in the courts of My sanctuary.
Go through, go through the gates; Clear the way for the people; Build up, build up the highway; Remove the stones, lift up a standard over the peoples.
Behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, "Lo, your salvation comes; Behold His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him."
And they will call them, "The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord"; And you will be called, "Sought out, a city not forsaken."
