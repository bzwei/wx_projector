Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over; Their images are [consigned] to the beasts and the cattle. The things that you carry are burdensome, A load for the weary [beast.]
They stooped over, they have bowed down together; They could not rescue the burden, But have themselves gone into captivity.
"Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, You who have been borne by Me from birth, And have been carried from the womb;
Even to your old age, I shall be the same, And even to your graying years I shall bear [you!] I have done [it,] and I shall carry [you;] And I shall bear [you,] and I shall deliver [you.]
"To whom would you liken Me, And make Me equal and compare Me, That we should be alike?
"Those who lavish gold from the purse And weigh silver on the scale Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it [into] a god; They bow down, indeed they worship it.
"They lift it upon the shoulder and carry it; They set it in its place and it stands [there.] It does not move from its place. Though one may cry to it, it cannot answer; It cannot deliver him from his distress.
"Remember this, and be assured; Recall it to mind, you transgressors.
"Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; [I am] God, and there is no one like Me,
Declaring the end from the beginning And from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying,' My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure';
Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man of My purpose from a far country. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned [it, surely] I will do it.
"Listen to Me, you stubborn-minded, Who are far from righteousness.
"I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off; And My salvation will not delay. And I will grant salvation in Zion, [And] My glory for Israel.
