Behold, a king will reign righteously, And princes will rule justly.
And each will be like a refuge from the wind, And a shelter from the storm, Like streams of water in a dry country, Like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land.
Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded, And the ears of those who hear will listen.
And the mind of the hasty will discern the truth, And the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak clearly.
No longer will the fool be called noble, Or the rogue be spoken of [as] generous.
For a fool speaks nonsense, And his heart inclines toward wickedness, To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the Lord, To keep the hungry person unsatisfied And to withhold drink from the thirsty.
As for a rogue, his weapons are evil; He devises wicked schemes To destroy [the] afflicted with slander, Even though [the] needy one speaks what is right.
But the noble man devises noble plans; And by noble plans he stands.
Rise up you women who are at ease, And hear my voice; Give ear to my word, You complacent daughters.
Within a year and [a few] days, You will be troubled, O complacent [daughters;] For the vintage is ended, And the [fruit] gathering will not come.
Tremble, you [women] who are at ease; Be troubled, you complacent [daughters;] Strip, undress, and put [sackcloth] on [your] waist,
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,
For the land of my people [in which] thorns [and] briars shall come up; Yea, for all the joyful houses, [and for] the jubilant city.
Because the palace has been abandoned, the populated city forsaken. Hill and watch-tower have become caves forever, A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks;
Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fertile field And the fertile field is considered as a forest.
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness will abide in the fertile field.
And the work of righteousness will be peace, And the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
Then my people will live in a peaceful habitation, And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places;
And it will hail when the forest comes down, And the city will be utterly laid low.
How blessed will you be, you who sow beside all waters, Who let out freely the ox and the donkey.
