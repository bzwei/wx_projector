Then you will say on that day, "I will give thanks to Thee, O Lord; For although Thou wast angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, And Thou dost comfort me.
"Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; For the Lord God is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation."
Therefore you will joyously draw water From the springs of salvation.
And in that day you will say, "Give thanks to the Lord, call on His name. Make known His deeds among the peoples; Make [them] remember that His name is exalted."
Praise the Lord in song, for He has done excellent things; Let this be known throughout the earth.
Cry aloud and shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
