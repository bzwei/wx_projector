And it came about that when Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
Now when John in prison heard of the works of Christ, he sent [word] by his disciples,
and said to Him, "Are You the Expected One, or shall we look for someone else?"
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you hear and see:
[the] blind receive sight and [the] lame walk, [the] lepers are cleansed and [the] deaf hear, and [the] dead are raised up, and [the] poor have the gospel preached to them.
"And blessed is he who keeps from stumbling over Me."
And as these were going [away,] Jesus began to speak to the multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?
"But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft [clothing]? Behold, those who wear soft [clothing] are in kings' palaces.
"But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one who is more than a prophet.
"This is the one about whom it is written, 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.'
"Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen [anyone] greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.
"For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
"And if you care to accept [it,] he himself is Elijah, who was to come.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places, who call out to the other [children],
and say,' We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'
"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!'
"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds."
Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had occurred in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
"Nevertheless I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in [the] day of judgment, than for you.
"And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You shall descend to Hades; for if the miracles had occurred in Sodom which occurred in you, it would have remained to this day.
"Nevertheless I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in [the] day of judgment, than for you."
At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou didst hide these things from [the] wise and intelligent and didst reveal them to babes.
"Yes, Father, for thus it was well-pleasing in Thy sight.
"All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son, except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal [Him.]
"Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.
"Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart; and you shall find rest for your souls.
"For My yoke is easy, and My load is light."
