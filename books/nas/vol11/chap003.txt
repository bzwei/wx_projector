Then Solomon formed a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her to the city of David, until he had finished building his own house and the house of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem.
The people were still sacrificing on the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the Lord until those days.
Now Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of his father David, except he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night; and God said, "Ask what [you wish] me to give you."
Then Solomon said, "Thou hast shown great lovingkindness to Thy servant David my father, according as he walked before Thee in truth and righteousness and uprightness of heart toward Thee; and Thou hast reserved for him this great lovingkindness, that Thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as [it is] this day.
"And now, O Lord my God, Thou hast made Thy servant king in place of my father David, yet I am but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
"And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people which Thou hast chosen, a great people who cannot be numbered or counted for multitude.
"So give Thy servant an understanding heart to judge Thy people to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Thine?"
And it was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.
And God said to him, "Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself discernment to understand justice,
behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you.
"And I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days.
"And if you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days."
Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and made peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.
Then two women who were harlots came to the king and stood before him.
And the one woman said, "Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she [was] in the house.
"And it happened on the third day after I gave birth, that this woman also gave birth to a child, and we were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, only the two of us in the house.
"And this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on it.
"So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom.
"And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead; but when I looked at him carefully in the morning, behold, he was not my son, whom I had borne."
Then the other woman said, "No! For the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son." But the first woman said, "No! For the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son." Thus they spoke before the king.
Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son who is living, and your son is the dead one'; and the other says, 'No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.'"
And the king said, "Get me a sword." So they brought a sword before the king.
And the king said, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other."
Then the woman whose child [was] the living one spoke to the king, for she was deeply stirred over her son and said, "Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him." But the other said, "He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide [him!]"
Then the king answered and said, "Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him. She is his mother."
When all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had handed down, they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.
