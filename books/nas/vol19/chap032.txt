([A Psalm] of David. A Maskil.) How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered!
How blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit!
When I kept silent [about my sin], my body wasted away Through my groaning all day long.
For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; My vitality was drained away [as] with the fever heat of summer. Selah.
I acknowledged my sin to Thee, And my iniquity I did not hide; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord"; And Thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin. Selah.
Therefore, let everyone who is godly pray to Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; Surely in a flood of great waters they shall not reach him.
Thou art my hiding place; Thou dost preserve me from trouble; Thou dost surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you with My eye upon you.
Do not be as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding, Whose trappings include bit and bridle to hold them in check, [Otherwise] they will not come near to you.
Many are the sorrows of the wicked; But he who trusts in the Lord, lovingkindness shall surround him.
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous ones, And shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.
