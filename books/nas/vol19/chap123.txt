(A Song of Ascents.) To Thee I lift up my eyes, O Thou who art enthroned in the heavens!
Behold, as the eyes of servants [look] to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; So our eyes [look] to the Lord our God, Until He shall be gracious to us.
Be gracious to us, O Lord, be gracious to us; For we are greatly filled with contempt.
Our soul is greatly filled With the scoffing of those who are at ease, [And] with the contempt of the proud.
