([A Psalm of] Praise, of David.) I will extol Thee, my God, O King; And I will bless Thy name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless Thee, And I will praise Thy name forever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised; And His greatness is unsearchable.
One generation shall praise Thy works to another, And shall declare Thy mighty acts.
On the glorious splendor of Thy majesty, And on Thy wonderful works, I will meditate.
And men shall speak of the power of Thine awesome acts; And I will tell of Thy greatness.
They shall eagerly utter the memory of Thine abundant goodness, And shall shout joyfully of Thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful; Slow to anger and great in lovingkindness.
The Lord is good to all, And His mercies are over all His works.
All Thy works shall give thanks to Thee, O Lord, And Thy godly ones shall bless Thee.
They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom, And talk of Thy power;
To make known to the sons of men Thy mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of Thy kingdom.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And Thy dominion [endures] throughout all generations.
The Lord sustains all who fall, And raises up all who are bowed down.
The eyes of all look to Thee, And Thou dost give them their food in due time.
Thou dost open Thy hand, And dost satisfy the desire of every living thing.
The Lord is righteous in all His ways, And kind in all His deeds.
The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, To all who call upon Him in truth.
He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He will also hear their cry and will save them.
The Lord keeps all who love Him; But all the wicked, He will destroy.
My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord; And all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever.
