(A Song of Ascents, of David.) I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the Lord."
Our feet are standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, that is built As a city that is compact together;
To which the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord-- An ordinance for Israel-- To give thanks to the name of the Lord.
For there thrones were set for judgment, The thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May they prosper who love you.
"May peace be within your walls, And prosperity within your palaces."
For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will now say, "May peace be within you."
For the sake of the house of the Lord our God I will seek your good.
