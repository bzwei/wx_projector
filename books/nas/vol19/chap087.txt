(A Psalm of the sons of Korah. A Song.) His foundation is in the holy mountains.
The Lord loves the gates of Zion More than all the [other] dwelling places of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.
"I shall mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia: 'This one was born there.'"
But of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; And the Most High Himself will establish her.
The Lord shall count when He registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah.
Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes [shall say], "All my springs [of joy] are in you."
