The Lord reigns; let the earth rejoice; Let the many islands be glad.
Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
Fire goes before Him, And burns up His adversaries round about.
His lightnings lit up the world; The earth saw and trembled.
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declare His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His glory.
Let all those be ashamed who serve graven images, Who boast themselves of idols; Worship Him, all you gods.
Zion heard [this] and was glad, And the daughters of Judah have rejoiced Because of Thy judgments, O Lord.
For Thou art the Lord Most High over all the earth; Thou art exalted far above all gods.
Hate evil, you who love the Lord, Who preserves the souls of His godly ones; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown [like seed] for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart.
Be glad in the Lord, you righteous ones; And give thanks to His holy name.
