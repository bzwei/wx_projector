(A Song of Ascents.) Those who trust in the Lord Are as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the Lord surrounds His people From this time forth and forever.
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the land of the righteous; That the righteous may not put forth their hands to do wrong.
Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, And to those who are upright in their hearts.
But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, The Lord will lead them away with the doers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
