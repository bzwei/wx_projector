(A Psalm.) O Sing to the Lord a new song, For He has done wonderful things, His right hand and His holy arm have gained the victory for Him.
The Lord has made known His salvation; He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.
He has remembered His lovingkindness and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth; Break forth and sing for joy and sing praises.
Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre; With the lyre and the sound of melody.
With trumpets and the sound of the horn Shout joyfully before the King, the Lord.
Let the sea roar and all it contains, The world and those who dwell in it.
Let the rivers clap their hands; Let the mountains sing together for joy
Before the Lord; for He is coming to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity.
