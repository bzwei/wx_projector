(A Song of Ascents.) Remember, O Lord, on David's behalf, All his affliction;
How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
"Surely I will not enter my house, Nor lie on my bed;
I will not give sleep to my eyes, Or slumber to my eyelids;
Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob. "
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the field of Jaar.
Let us go into His dwelling place; Let us worship at His footstool.
Arise, O Lord, to Thy resting place; Thou and the ark of Thy strength.
Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness; And let Thy godly ones sing for joy.
For the sake of David Thy servant, Do not turn away the face of Thine anointed.
The Lord has sworn to David, A truth from which He will not turn back; "Of the fruit of your body I will set upon your throne.
"If your sons will keep My covenant, And My testimony which I will teach them, Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forever."
For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation.
"This is My resting place forever; Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
"I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her needy with bread.
"Her priests also I will clothe with salvation; And her godly ones will sing aloud for joy.
"There I will cause the horn of David to spring forth; I have prepared a lamp for Mine anointed.
"His enemies I will clothe with shame; But upon himself his crown shall shine."
