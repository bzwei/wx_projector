(A Song, a Psalm of David.) My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.
Awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn!
I will give thanks to Thee, O Lord, among the peoples; And I will sing praises to Thee among the nations.
For Thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And Thy truth [reaches] to the skies.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, And Thy glory above all the earth.
That Thy beloved may be delivered, Save with Thy right hand, and answer me!
God has spoken in His holiness: "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem, And measure out the valley of Succoth.
"Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.
"Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Over Philistia I will shout aloud."
Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Hast not Thou Thyself, O God, rejected us? And wilt Thou not go forth with our armies, O God?
Oh give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain.
Through God we shall do valiantly; And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.
