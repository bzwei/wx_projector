(For the choir director; according to the Shoshannim. A Maskil of the sons of) (Korah. A Song of Love.) My heart overflows with a good theme; I address my verses to the King; My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the sons of men; Grace is poured upon Thy lips; Therefore God has blessed Thee forever.
Gird Thy sword on [Thy] thigh, O Mighty One, [In] Thy splendor and Thy majesty!
And in Thy majesty ride on victoriously, For the cause of truth and meekness [and] righteousness; Let Thy right hand teach Thee awesome things.
Thine arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under Thee; [Thine arrows are] in the heart of the King's enemies.
Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; Therefore God, Thy God, has anointed Thee With the oil of joy above Thy fellows.
All Thy garments are [fragrant with] myrrh and aloes [and] cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made Thee glad.
Kings' daughters are among Thy noble ladies; At Thy right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.
Listen, O daughter, give attention and incline your ear; Forget your people and your father's house;
Then the King will desire your beauty; Because He is your Lord, bow down to Him.
And the daughter of Tyre [will come] with a gift; The rich among the people will entreat your favor.
The King's daughter is all glorious within; Her clothing is interwoven with gold.
She will be led to the King in embroidered work; The virgins, her companions who follow her, Will be brought to Thee.
They will be led forth with gladness and rejoicing; They will enter into the King's palace.
In place of your fathers will be your sons; You shall make them princes in all the earth.
I will cause Thy name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the peoples will give Thee thanks forever and ever.
