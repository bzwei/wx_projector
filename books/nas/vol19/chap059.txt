(For the choir director; [set to] Al-tashheth. A Mikhtam of David, when Saul) (sent [men,] and they watched the house in order to kill him.) Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; Set me [securely] on high away from those who rise up against me.
Deliver me from those who do iniquity, And save me from men of bloodshed.
For behold, they have set an ambush for my life; Fierce men launch an attack against me, Not for my transgression nor for my sin, O Lord,
For no guilt of [mine], they run and set themselves against me. Arouse Thyself to help me, and see!
And Thou, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be gracious to any [who are] treacherous in iniquity. Selah.
They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go around the city.
Behold, they belch forth with their mouth; Swords are in their lips, For, [they say,] "Who hears?"
But Thou, O Lord, dost laugh at them; Thou dost scoff at all the nations.
[Because of] his strength I will watch for Thee, For God is my stronghold.
My God in His lovingkindness will meet me; God will let me look [triumphantly] upon my foes.
Do not slay them, lest my people forget; Scatter them by Thy power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
[On account of] the sin of their mouth [and] the words of their lips, Let them even be caught in their pride, And on account of curses and lies which they utter.
Destroy [them] in wrath, destroy [them], that they may be no more; That [men] may know that God rules in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah.
And they return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go around the city.
They wander about for food, And growl if they are not satisfied.
But as for me, I shall sing of Thy strength; Yes, I shall joyfully sing of Thy lovingkindness in the morning, For Thou hast been my stronghold, And a refuge in the day of my distress.
O my strength, I will sing praises to Thee; For God is my stronghold, the God who shows me lovingkindness.
