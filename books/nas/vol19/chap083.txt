(A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.) O God, do not remain quiet; Do not be silent and, O God, do not be still.
For, behold, Thine enemies make an uproar; And those who hate Thee have exalted themselves.
They make shrewd plans against Thy people, And conspire together against Thy treasured ones.
They have said, "Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation, That the name of Israel be remembered no more."
For they have conspired together with one mind; Against Thee do they make a covenant:
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Assyria also has joined with them; They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah.
Deal with them as with Midian, As with Sisera [and] Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
Who were destroyed at En-dor, Who became as dung for the ground.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
Who said, "Let us possess for ourselves The pastures of God."
O my God, make them like the whirling dust; Like chaff before the wind.
Like fire that burns the forest, And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire,
So pursue them with Thy tempest, And terrify them with Thy storm.
Fill their faces with dishonor, That they may seek Thy name, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever; And let them be humiliated and perish,
That they may know that Thou alone, whose name is the Lord, Art the Most High over all the earth.
