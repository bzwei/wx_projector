(A Psalm of David.) The Lord says to my Lord: "Sit at My right hand, Until I make Thine enemies a footstool for Thy feet."
The Lord will stretch forth Thy strong scepter from Zion, [saying], "Rule in the midst of Thine enemies."
Thy people will volunteer freely in the day of Thy power; In holy array, from the womb of the dawn, Thy youth are to Thee [as] the dew.
The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind, "Thou art a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek."
The Lord is at Thy right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath.
He will judge among the nations, He will fill [them] with corpses, He will shatter the chief men over a broad country.
He will drink from the brook by the wayside; Therefore He will lift up [His] head.
