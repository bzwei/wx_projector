([A Psalm] of David.) Blessed be the Lord, my rock, Who trains my hands for war, [And] my fingers for battle;
My lovingkindness and my fortress, My stronghold and my deliverer; My shield and He in whom I take refuge; Who subdues my people under me.
O Lord, what is man, that Thou dost take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that Thou dost think of him?
Man is like a mere breath; His days are like a passing shadow.
Bow Thy heavens, O Lord, and come down; Touch the mountains, that they may smoke.
Flash forth lightning and scatter them; Send out Thine arrows and confuse them.
Stretch forth Thy hand from on high; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens
Whose mouths speak deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
I will sing a new song to Thee, O God; Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to Thee,
Who dost give salvation to kings; Who dost rescue David His servant from the evil sword.
Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaks deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
Let our sons in their youth be as grown-up plants, And our daughters as corner pillars fashioned as for a palace;
[Let] our garners be full, furnishing every kind of produce, [And] our flocks bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
[Let] our cattle bear, Without mishap and without loss, [Let there be] no outcry in our streets!
How blessed are the people who are so situated; How blessed are the people whose God is the Lord!
