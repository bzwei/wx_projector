(A Song of Ascents.) In my trouble I cried to the Lord, And He answered me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips, From a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, You deceitful tongue?
Sharp arrows of the warrior, With the [burning] coals of the broom tree.
Woe is me, for I sojourn in Meshech, For I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
Too long has my soul had its dwelling With those who hate peace.
I am [for] peace, but when I speak, They are for war.
