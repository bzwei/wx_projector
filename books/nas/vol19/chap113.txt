Praise the Lord! Praise, O servants of the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord.
Blessed be the name of the Lord From this time forth and forever.
From the rising of the sun to its setting The name of the Lord is to be praised.
The Lord is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.
Who is like the Lord our God, Who is enthroned on high,
Who humbles Himself to behold [The things that are] in heaven and in the earth?
He raises the poor from the dust, And lifts the needy from the ash heap,
To make [them] sit with princes, With the princes of His people.
He makes the barren woman abide in the house [As] a joyful mother of children. Praise the Lord!
