(For the choir director; for flute accompaniment. A Psalm of David.) Give ear to my words, O Lord, Consider my groaning.
Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to Thee do I pray.
In the morning, O Lord, Thou wilt hear my voice; In the morning I will order [my prayer]to Thee and [eagerly] watch.
For Thou art not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil dwells with Thee.
The boastful shall not stand before Thine eyes; Thou dost hate all who do iniquity.
Thou dost destroy those who speak falsehood; The Lord abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.
But as for me, by Thine abundant lovingkindness I will enter Thy house, At Thy holy temple I will bow in reverence for Thee.
O Lord, lead me in Thy righteousness because of my foes; Make Thy way straight before me.
There is nothing reliable in what they say; Their inward part is destruction [itself]; Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue.
Hold them guilty, O God; By their own devices let them fall! In the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out, For they are rebellious against Thee.
But let all who take refuge in Thee be glad, Let them ever sing for joy; And mayest Thou shelter them, That those who love Thy name may exult in Thee.
For it is Thou who dost bless the righteous man, O Lord, Thou dost surround him with favor as with a shield.
