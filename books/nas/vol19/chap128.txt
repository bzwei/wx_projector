(A Song of Ascents.) How blessed is everyone who fears the Lord, Who walks in His ways.
When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, You will be happy and it will be well with you.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine, Within your house, Your children like olive plants Around your table.
Behold, for thus shall the man be blessed Who fears the Lord.
The Lord bless you from Zion, And may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
Indeed, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
