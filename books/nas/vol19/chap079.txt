(A Psalm of Asaph.) O God, the nations have invaded Thine inheritance; They have defiled Thy holy temple; They have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants for food to the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Thy godly ones to the beasts of the earth.
They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem; And there was no one to bury them.
We have become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to those around us.
How long, O Lord? Wilt Thou be angry forever? Will Thy jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations which do not know Thee, And upon the kingdoms which do not call upon Thy name.
For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.
Do not remember the iniquities of [our] forefathers against us; Let Thy compassion come quickly to meet us; For we are brought very low.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake.
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let there be known among the nations in our sight, Vengeance for the blood of Thy servants, which has been shed.
Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; According to the greatness of Thy power preserve those who are doomed to die.
And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom The reproach with which they have reproached Thee, O Lord.
So we Thy people and the sheep of Thy pasture Will give thanks to Thee forever; To all generations we will tell of Thy praise.
