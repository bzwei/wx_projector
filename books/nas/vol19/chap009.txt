(For the choir director; on Muth-labben. A Psalm of David.) I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart; I will tell of all Thy wonders.
I will be glad and exult in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy name, O Most High.
When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before Thee.
For Thou hast maintained my just cause; Thou dost sit on the throne judging righteously.
Thou hast rebuked the nations; Thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name forever and ever.
The enemy has come to an end in perpetual ruins, And Thou hast uprooted the cities; The very memory of them has perished.
But the Lord abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment,
And He will judge the world in righteousness; He will execute judgment for the peoples with equity.
The Lord also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble,
And those who know Thy name will put their trust in Thee; For Thou, O Lord, hast not forsaken those who seek Thee.
Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion; Declare among the peoples His deeds.
For He who requires blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
Be gracious to me, O Lord; Behold my affliction from those who hate me, Thou who dost lift me up from the gates of death;
That I may tell of all Thy praises, That in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Thy salvation.
The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made; In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught.
The Lord has made Himself known; He has executed judgment. In the work of his own hands the wicked is snared. Higgaion Selah.
The wicked will return to Sheol, [Even] all the nations who forget God.
For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever.
Arise, O Lord, do not let man prevail; Let the nations be judged before Thee.
Put them in fear, O Lord; Let the nations know that they are but men. Selah.
