(A Psalm of David.) Hear my prayer, O Lord, Give ear to my supplications! Answer me in Thy faithfulness, in Thy righteousness!
And do not enter into judgment with Thy servant, For in Thy sight no man living is righteous.
For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, like those who have long been dead.
Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart is appalled within me.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Thy doings; I muse on the work of Thy hands.
I stretch out my hands to Thee; My soul [longs] for Thee, as a parched land. Selah.
Answer me quickly, O Lord, my spirit fails; Do not hide Thy face from me, Lest I become like those who go down to the pit.
Let me hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning; For I trust in Thee; Teach me the way in which I should walk; For to Thee I lift up my soul.
Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies; I take refuge in Thee.
Teach me to do Thy will, For Thou art my God; Let Thy good Spirit lead me on level ground.
For the sake of Thy name, O Lord, revive me. In Thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
And in Thy lovingkindness cut off my enemies, And destroy all those who afflict my soul; For I am Thy servant.
