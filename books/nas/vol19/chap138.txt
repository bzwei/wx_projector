([A Psalm] of David.) I will give Thee thanks with all my heart; I will sing praises to Thee before the gods.
I will bow down toward Thy holy temple, And give thanks to Thy name for Thy lovingkindness and Thy truth; For Thou hast magnified Thy word according to all Thy name.
On the day I called Thou didst answer me; Thou didst make me bold with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth will give thanks to Thee, O Lord, When they have heard the words of Thy mouth.
And they will sing of the ways of the Lord. For great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord is exalted, Yet He regards the lowly; But the haughty He knows from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou wilt revive me; Thou wilt stretch forth Thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, And Thy right hand will save me.
The Lord will accomplish what concerns me; Thy lovingkindness, O Lord, is everlasting; Do not forsake the works of Thy hands.
