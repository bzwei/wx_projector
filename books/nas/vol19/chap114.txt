When Israel went forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
Judah became His sanctuary, Israel, His dominion.
The sea looked and fled; The Jordan turned back.
The mountains skipped like rams, The hills, like lambs.
What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?
O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs?
Tremble, O earth, before the Lord, Before the God of Jacob,
Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of water.
