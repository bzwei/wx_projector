(A Psalm of David.) The earth is the Lord's, and all it contains, The world, and those who dwell in it.
For He has founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the rivers.
Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord? And who may stand in His holy place?
He who has clean hands and a pure heart, Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, And has not sworn deceitfully.
He shall receive a blessing from the Lord And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
This is the generation of those who seek Him, Who seek Thy face-- [even] Jacob. Selah.
Lift up your heads, O gates, And be lifted up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!
Who is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, The Lord mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, O gates, And lift [them] up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!
Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah.
