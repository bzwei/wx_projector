(A Song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choir director; according to) (Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.) O Lord, the God of my salvation, I have cried out by day and in the night before Thee.
Let my prayer come before Thee; Incline Thine ear to my cry!
For my soul has had enough troubles, And my life has drawn near to Sheol.
I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit; I have become like a man without strength,
Forsaken among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom Thou dost remember no more, And they are cut off from Thy hand.
Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the depths.
Thy wrath has rested upon me, And Thou hast afflicted me with all Thy waves. Selah.
Thou hast removed my acquaintances far from me; Thou hast made me an object of loathing to them; I am shut up and cannot go out.
My eye has wasted away because of affliction; I have called upon Thee every day, O Lord; I have spread out my hands to Thee.
Wilt Thou perform wonders for the dead? Will the departed spirits rise [and] praise Thee? Selah.
Will Thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave, Thy faithfulness in Abaddon?
Will Thy wonders be made known in the darkness? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
But I, O Lord, have cried out to Thee for help, And in the morning my prayer comes before Thee.
O Lord, why dost Thou reject my soul? [Why] dost Thou hide Thy face from me?
I was afflicted and about to die from my youth on; I suffer Thy terrors; I am overcome.
Thy burning anger has passed over me; Thy terrors have destroyed me.
They have surrounded me like water all day long; They have encompassed me altogether.
Thou hast removed lover and friend far from me; My acquaintances are [in] darkness.
