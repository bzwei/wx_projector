(A Psalm of Asaph.) God takes His stand in His own congregation; He judges in the midst of the rulers.
How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked? Selah.
Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
Rescue the weak and needy; Deliver [them] out of the hand of the wicked.
They do not know nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I said, "You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High.
"Nevertheless you will die like men, And fall like [any] one of the princes."
Arise, O God, judge the earth! For it is Thou who dost possess all the nations.
