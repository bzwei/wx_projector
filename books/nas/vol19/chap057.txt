(For the choir director; [set to] Al-tashheth. A Mikhtam of David, when he fled) (from Saul, in the cave.) Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, For my soul takes refuge in Thee; And in the shadow of Thy wings I will take refuge, Until destruction passes by.
I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes [all things] for me.
He will send from heaven and save me; He reproaches him who tramples upon me. Selah. God will send forth His lovingkindness and His truth.
My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire, [Even] the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; [Let] Thy glory [be] above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They dug a pit before me; They [themselves] have fallen into the midst of it. Selah.
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises!
Awake, my glory; Awake, harp and lyre, I will awaken the dawn!
I will give thanks to Thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to Thee among the nations.
For Thy lovingkindness is great to the heavens, And Thy truth to the clouds.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; [Let] Thy glory [be] above all the earth.
