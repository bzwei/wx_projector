Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song, And His praise in the congregation of the godly ones.
Let Israel be glad in his Maker; Let the sons of Zion rejoice in their King.
Let them praise His name with dancing; Let them sing praises to Him with timbrel and lyre.
For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the afflicted ones with salvation.
Let the godly ones exult in glory; Let them sing for joy on their beds.
[Let] the high praises of God [be] in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand,
To execute vengeance on the nations, And punishment on the peoples;
To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;
To execute on them the judgment written; This is an honor for all His godly ones. Praise the Lord!
