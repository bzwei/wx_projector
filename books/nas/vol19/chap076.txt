(For the choir director; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.) God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
And His tabernacle is in Salem; His dwelling place also is in Zion.
There He broke the flaming arrows, The shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.
Thou art resplendent, More majestic than the mountains of prey.
The stouthearted were plundered; They sank into sleep; And none of the warriors could use his hands.
At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep.
Thou, even Thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in Thy presence when once Thou art angry?
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,
When God arose to judgment, To save all the humble of the earth. Selah.
For the wrath of man shall praise Thee; With a remnant of wrath Thou shalt gird Thyself.
Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill [them]; Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared.
He will cut off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
