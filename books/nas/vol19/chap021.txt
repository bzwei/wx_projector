(For the choir director. A Psalm of David.) O Lord, in Thy strength the king will be glad, And in Thy salvation how greatly he will rejoice!
Thou hast given him his heart's desire, And Thou hast not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
For Thou dost meet him with the blessings of good things; Thou dost set a crown of fine gold on his head.
He asked life of Thee, Thou didst give it to him, Length of days forever and ever.
His glory is great through Thy salvation, Splendor and majesty Thou dost place upon him.
For Thou dost make him most blessed forever; Thou dost make him joyful with gladness in Thy presence.
For the king trusts in the Lord, And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he will not be shaken.
Your hand will find out all your enemies; Your right hand will find out those who hate you.
You will make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger; The Lord will swallow them up in His wrath, And fire will devour them.
Their offspring Thou wilt destroy from the earth, And their descendants from among the sons of men.
Though they intended evil against Thee, [And] devised a plot, They will not succeed.
For Thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt aim with Thy bowstrings at their faces.
Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy strength; We will sing and praise Thy power.
