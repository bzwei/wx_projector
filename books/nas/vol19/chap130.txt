(A Song of Ascents.) Out of the depths I have cried to Thee, O Lord.
Lord, hear my voice! Let Thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.
If Thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
But there is forgiveness with Thee, That Thou mayest be feared.
I wait for the Lord, my soul does wait, And in His word do I hope.
My soul [waits] for the Lord More than the watchmen for the morning; [Indeed, more than] the watchmen for the morning.
O Israel, hope in the Lord; For with the Lord there is lovingkindness, And with Him is abundant redemption.
And He will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
