(For the choir director. A Song. A Psalm.) Shout joyfully to God, all the earth;
Sing the glory of His name; Make His praise glorious.
Say to God, "How awesome are Thy works! Because of the greatness of Thy power Thine enemies will give feigned obedience to Thee.
"All the earth will worship Thee, And will sing praises to Thee; They will sing praises to Thy name." Selah.
Come and see the works of God, [Who is] awesome in [His] deeds toward the sons of men.
He turned the sea into dry land; They passed through the river on foot; There let us rejoice in Him!
He rules by His might forever; His eyes keep watch on the nations; Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
Bless our God, O peoples, And sound His praise abroad,
Who keeps us in life, And does not allow our feet to slip.
For Thou hast tried us, O God; Thou hast refined us as silver is refined.
Thou didst bring us into the net; Thou didst lay an oppressive burden upon our loins.
Thou didst make men ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; Yet Thou didst bring us out into [a place of] abundance.
I shall come into Thy house with burnt offerings; I shall pay Thee my vows,
Which my lips uttered And my mouth spoke when I was in distress.
I shall offer to Thee burnt offerings of fat beasts, With the smoke of rams; I shall make [an offering of] bulls with male goats. Selah.
Come [and] hear, all who fear God, And I will tell of what He has done for my soul.
I cried to Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue.
If I regard wickedness in my heart, The Lord will not hear;
But certainly God has heard; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer, Nor His lovingkindness from me.
