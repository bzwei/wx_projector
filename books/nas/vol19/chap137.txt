By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down and wept, When we remembered Zion.
Upon the willows in the midst of it We hung our harps.
For there our captors demanded of us songs, And our tormentors mirth, [saying], "Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
How can we sing the Lord's song In a foreign land?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, May my right hand forget [her skill.]
May my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I do not remember you, If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy.
Remember, O Lord, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem, Who said, "Raze it, raze it, To its very foundation."
O daughter of Babylon, you devastated one, How blessed will be the one who repays you With the recompense with which you have repaid us.
How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against the rock.
