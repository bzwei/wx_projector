The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The Lord has clothed and girded Himself with strength; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved.
Thy throne is established from of old; Thou art from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O Lord, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their pounding waves.
More than the sounds of many waters, [Than] the mighty breakers of the sea, The Lord on high is mighty.
Thy testimonies are fully confirmed; Holiness befits Thy house, O Lord, forevermore.
