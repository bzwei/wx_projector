The Lord reigns, let the peoples tremble; He is enthroned [above] the cherubim, let the earth shake!
The Lord is great in Zion, And He is exalted above all the peoples.
Let them praise Thy great and awesome name; Holy is He.
And the strength of the King loves justice; Thou hast established equity; Thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at His footstool; Holy is He.
Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among those who called on His name; They called upon the Lord, and He answered them.
He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; They kept His testimonies, And the statute that He gave them.
O Lord our God, Thou didst answer them; Thou wast a forgiving God to them, And [yet] an avenger of their [evil] deeds.
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at His holy hill; For holy is the Lord our God.
