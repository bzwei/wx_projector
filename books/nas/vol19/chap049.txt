(For the choir director. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.) Hear this, all peoples; Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
Both low and high, Rich and poor together.
My mouth will speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart [will be] understanding.
I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will express my riddle on the harp.
Why should I fear in days of adversity, When the iniquity of my foes surrounds me,
Even those who trust in their wealth, And boast in the abundance of their riches?
No man can by any means redeem [his] brother, Or give to God a ransom for him--
For the redemption of his soul is costly, And he should cease [trying] forever--
That he should live on eternally; That he should not undergo decay.
For he sees [that even] wise men die; The stupid and the senseless alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.
Their inner thought is, [that] their houses are forever, [And] their dwelling places to all generations; They have called their lands after their own names.
But man in [his] pomp will not endure; He is like the beasts that perish.
This is the way of those who are foolish, And of those after them who approve their words. Selah.
As sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall rule over them in the morning; And their form shall be for Sheol to consume, So that they have no habitation.
But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For He will receive me. Selah.
Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich, When the glory of his house is increased;
For when he dies he will carry nothing away; His glory will not descend after him.
Though while he lives he congratulates himself-- And though [men] praise you when you do well for yourself--
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.
Man in [his] pomp, yet without understanding, Is like the beasts that perish.
