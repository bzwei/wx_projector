(For the choir director. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the Lord.) Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For it flatters him in his [own] eyes, Concerning the discovery of his iniquity [and] the hatred [of it.]
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise [and] to do good.
He plans wickedness upon his bed; He sets himself on a path that is not good; He does not despise evil.
Thy lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the heavens, Thy faithfulness [reaches] to the skies.
Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments are [like] a great deep. O Lord, Thou preservest man and beast.
How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.
They drink their fill of the abundance of Thy house; And Thou dost give them to drink of the river of Thy delights.
For with Thee is the fountain of life; In Thy light we see light.
O continue Thy lovingkindness to those who know Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come upon me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
There the doers of iniquity have fallen; They have been thrust down and cannot rise.
