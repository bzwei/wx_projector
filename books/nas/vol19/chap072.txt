([A Psalm] of Solomon.) Give the king Thy judgments, O God, And Thy righteousness to the king's son.
May he judge Thy people with righteousness, And Thine afflicted with justice.
Let the mountains bring peace to the people, And the hills in righteousness.
May he vindicate the afflicted of the people, Save the children of the needy, And crush the oppressor.
Let them fear Thee while the sun [endures], And as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, Like showers that water the earth.
In his days may the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace till the moon is no more.
May he also rule from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.
Let the nomads of the desert bow before him; And his enemies lick the dust.
Let the kings of Tarshish and of the islands bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
And let all kings bow down before him, All nations serve him.
For he will deliver the needy when he cries for help, The afflicted also, and him who has no helper.
He will have compassion on the poor and needy, And the lives of the needy he will save.
He will rescue their life from oppression and violence; And their blood will be precious in his sight;
So may he live; and may the gold of Sheba be given to him; And let them pray for him continually; Let them bless him all day long.
May there be abundance of grain in the earth on top of the mountains; Its fruit will wave like [the cedars of] Lebanon; And may those from the city flourish like vegetation of the earth.
May his name endure forever; May his name increase as long as the sun [shines]; And let [men] bless themselves by him; Let all nations call him blessed.
Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, Who alone works wonders.
And blessed be His glorious name forever; And may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
