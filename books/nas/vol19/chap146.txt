Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord, O my soul!
I will praise the Lord while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
Do not trust in princes, In mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.
His spirit departs, he returns to the earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.
How blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, Whose hope is in the Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, The sea and all that is in them; Who keeps faith forever;
Who executes justice for the oppressed; Who gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets the prisoners free.
The Lord opens [the eyes of] the blind; The Lord raises up those who are bowed down; The Lord loves the righteous;
The Lord protects the strangers; He supports the fatherless and the widow; But He thwarts the way of the wicked.
The Lord will reign forever, Thy God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the Lord!
