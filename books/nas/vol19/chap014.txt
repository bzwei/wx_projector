(For the choir director. [A Psalm] of David.) The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they have committed abominable deeds; There is no one who does good.
The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, To see if there are any who understand, Who seek after God.
They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.
Do all the workers of wickedness not know, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, [And] do not call upon the Lord?
There they are in great dread, For God is with the righteous generation.
You would put to shame the counsel of the afflicted, But the Lord is his refuge.
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores His captive people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.
