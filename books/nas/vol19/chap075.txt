(For the choir director; [set to] Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.) We give thanks to Thee, O God, we give thanks, For Thy name is near; Men declare Thy wondrous works.
"When I select an appointed time, It is I who judge with equity.
"The earth and all who dwell in it melt; It is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah.
"I said to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn;
Do not lift up your horn on high, Do not speak with insolent pride.' "
For not from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert [comes] exaltation;
But God is the Judge; He puts down one, and exalts another.
For a cup is in the hand of the Lord, and the wine foams; It is well mixed, and He pours out of this; Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain [and] drink down its dregs.
But as for me, I will declare [it] forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
And all the horns of the wicked He will cut off, [But] the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
