(For the choir director; according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.) My voice [rises] to God, and I will cry aloud; My voice [rises] to God, and He will hear me.
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; In the night my hand was stretched out without weariness; My soul refused to be comforted.
[When] I remember God, then I am disturbed; [When] I sigh, then my spirit grows faint. Selah.
Thou hast held my eyelids [open]; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old, The years of long ago.
I will remember my song in the night; I will meditate with my heart; And my spirit ponders.
Will the Lord reject forever? And will He never be favorable again?
Has His lovingkindness ceased forever? Has [His] promise come to an end forever?
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah.
Then I said, "It is my grief, That the right hand of the Most High has changed."
I shall remember the deeds of the Lord; Surely I will remember Thy wonders of old.
I will meditate on all Thy work, And muse on Thy deeds.
Thy way, O God, is holy; What god is great like our God?
Thou art the God who workest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.
Thou hast by Thy power redeemed Thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
The waters saw Thee, O God; The waters saw Thee, they were in anguish; The deeps also trembled.
The clouds poured out water; The skies gave forth a sound; Thy arrows flashed here and there.
The sound of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.
Thy way was in the sea, And Thy paths in the mighty waters, And Thy footprints may not be known.
Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
