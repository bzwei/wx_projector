(For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.) As the deer pants for the water brooks, So my soul pants for Thee, O God.
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; When shall I come and appear before God?
My tears have been my food day and night, While [they] say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
These things I remember, and I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go along with the throng [and] lead them in procession to the house of God, With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.
Why are you in despair, O my soul? And [why] have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him [For] the help of His presence.
O my God, my soul is in despair within me; Therefore I remember Thee from the land of the Jordan, And the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
Deep calls to deep at the sound of Thy waterfalls; All Thy breakers and Thy waves have rolled over me.
The Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime; And His song will be with me in the night, A prayer to the God of my life.
I will say to God my rock, "Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance, and my God.
