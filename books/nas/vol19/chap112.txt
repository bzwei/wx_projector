Praise the Lord! How blessed is the man who fears the Lord, Who greatly delights in His commandments.
His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed.
Wealth and riches are in his house, And his righteousness endures forever.
Light arises in the darkness for the upright; [He is] gracious and compassionate and righteous.
It is well with the man who is gracious and lends; He will maintain his cause in judgment.
For he will never be shaken; The righteous will be remembered forever.
He will not fear evil tidings; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord.
His heart is upheld, he will not fear, Until he looks [with satisfaction] on his adversaries.
He has given freely to the poor; His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted in honor.
The wicked will see it and be vexed; He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked will perish.
