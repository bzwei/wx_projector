(A Song of Ascents, of David.) O Lord, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes haughty; Nor do I involve myself in great matters, Or in things too difficult for me.
Surely I have composed and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child [rests] against his mother, My soul is like a weaned child within me.
O Israel, hope in the Lord From this time forth and forever.
