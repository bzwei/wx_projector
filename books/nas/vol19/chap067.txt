(For the choir director; with stringed instruments. A Psalm. A Song.) God be gracious to us and bless us, [And] cause His face to shine upon us-- Selah.
That Thy way may be known on the earth, Thy salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples praise Thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise Thee.
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy; For Thou wilt judge the peoples with uprightness, And guide the nations on the earth. Selah.
Let the peoples praise Thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise Thee.
The earth has yielded its produce; God, our God, blesses us.
God blesses us, That all the ends of the earth may fear Him.
