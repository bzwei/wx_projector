([A Psalm] of David.) Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have walked in my integrity; And I have trusted in the Lord without wavering.
Examine me, O Lord, and try me; Test my mind and my heart.
For Thy lovingkindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Thy truth.
I do not sit with deceitful men, Nor will I go with pretenders.
I hate the assembly of evildoers, And I will not sit with the wicked.
I shall wash my hands in innocence, And I will go about Thine altar, O Lord,
That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving, And declare all Thy wonders.
O Lord, I love the habitation of Thy house, And the place where Thy glory dwells.
Do not take my soul away [along] with sinners, Nor my life with men of bloodshed,
In whose hands is a wicked scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; Redeem me, and be gracious to me.
My foot stands on a level place; In the congregations I shall bless the Lord.
