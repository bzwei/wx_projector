(For the choir director. A Psalm of David.) How long, O Lord? Wilt Thou forget me forever? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, [Having] sorrow in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
Consider [and] answer me, O Lord, my God; Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the [sleep of] death,
Lest my enemy say, "I have overcome him," [Lest] my adversaries rejoice when I am shaken.
But I have trusted in Thy lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation.
I will sing to the Lord, Because He has dealt bountifully with me.
