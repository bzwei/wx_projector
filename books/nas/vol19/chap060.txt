(For the choir director; according to Shushan Eduth. A Mikhtam of David, to) (teach; when he struggled with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab) (returned, and smote twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.) O God, Thou hast rejected us. Thou hast broken us; Thou hast been angry; O, restore us.
Thou hast made the land quake, Thou hast split it open; Heal its breaches, for it totters.
Thou hast made Thy people experience hardship; Thou hast given us wine to drink that makes us stagger.
Thou hast given a banner to those who fear Thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
That Thy beloved may be delivered, Save with Thy right hand, and answer us!
God has spoken in His holiness: "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.
"Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.
"Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me!"
Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Hast not Thou Thyself, O God, rejected us? And wilt Thou not go forth with our armies, O God?
O give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain.
Through God we shall do valiantly, And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.
