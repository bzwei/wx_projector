(A Prayer of Moses the man of God.) Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
Before the mountains were born, Or Thou didst give birth to the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.
Thou dost turn man back into dust, And dost say, "Return, O children of men."
For a thousand years in Thy sight Are like yesterday when it passes by, Or [as] a watch in the night.
Thou hast swept them away like a flood, they fall asleep; In the morning they are like grass which sprouts anew.
In the morning it flourishes, and sprouts anew; Toward evening it fades, and withers away.
For we have been consumed by Thine anger, And by Thy wrath we have been dismayed.
Thou hast placed our iniquities before Thee, Our secret [sins] in the light of Thy presence.
For all our days have declined in Thy fury; We have finished our years like a sigh.
As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years, Or if due to strength, eighty years, Yet their pride is [but] labor and sorrow; For soon it is gone and we fly away.
Who understands the power of Thine anger, And Thy fury, according to the fear that is due Thee?
So teach us to number our days, That we may present to Thee a heart of wisdom.
Do return, O Lord; how long [will it be]? And be sorry for Thy servants.
O satisfy us in the morning with Thy lovingkindness, That we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
Make us glad according to the days Thou hast afflicted us, [And] the years we have seen evil.
Let Thy work appear to Thy servants, And Thy majesty to their children.
And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And do confirm for us the work of our hands; Yes, confirm the work of our hands.
