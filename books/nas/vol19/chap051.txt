(For the choir director. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him,) (after he had gone in to Bathsheba.) Be gracious to me, O God, according to Thy lovingkindness; According to the greatness of Thy compassion blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin.
For I know my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.
Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned, And done what is evil in Thy sight, So that Thou art justified when Thou dost speak, And blameless when Thou dost judge.
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me.
Behold, Thou dost desire truth in the innermost being, And in the hidden part Thou wilt make me know wisdom.
Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Make me to hear joy and gladness, Let the bones which Thou hast broken rejoice.
Hide Thy face from my sins, And blot out all my iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Do not cast me away from Thy presence, And do not take Thy Holy Spirit from me.
Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, And sustain me with a willing spirit.
[Then] I will teach transgressors Thy ways, And sinners will be converted to Thee.
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; [Then] my tongue will joyfully sing of Thy righteousness.
O Lord, open my lips, That my mouth may declare Thy praise.
For Thou dost not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it; Thou art not pleased with burnt offering.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.
By Thy favor do good to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem.
Then Thou wilt delight in righteous sacrifices, In burnt offering and whole burnt offering; Then young bulls will be offered on Thine altar.
