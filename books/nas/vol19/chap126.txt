(A Song of Ascents.) When the Lord brought back the captive ones of Zion, We were like those who dream.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with joyful shouting; Then they said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them."
The Lord has done great things for us; We are glad.
Restore our captivity, O Lord, As the streams in the South.
Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting.
He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying [his] bag of seed, Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves [with him].
