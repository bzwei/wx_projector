(For the choir director; with stringed instruments, upon an eight-stringed lyre.) (A Psalm of David.) O Lord, do not rebuke me in Thine anger, Nor chasten me in Thy wrath.
Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I [am] pining away; Heal me, O Lord, for my bones are dismayed.
And my soul is greatly dismayed; But Thou, O Lord-- how long?
Return, O Lord, rescue my soul; Save me because of Thy lovingkindness.
For there is no mention of Thee in death; In Sheol who will give Thee thanks?
I am weary with my sighing; Every night I make my bed swim, I dissolve my couch with my tears.
My eye has wasted away with grief; It has become old because of all my adversaries.
Depart from me, all you who do iniquity, For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.
The Lord has heard my supplication, The Lord receives my prayer.
All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly dismayed; They shall turn back, they shall suddenly be ashamed.
