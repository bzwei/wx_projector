(A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath day.) It is good to give thanks to the Lord, And to sing praises to Thy name, O Most High;
To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning, And Thy faithfulness by night,
With the ten-stringed lute, and with the harp; With resounding music upon the lyre.
For Thou, O Lord, hast made me glad by what Thou hast done, I will sing for joy at the works of Thy hands.
How great are Thy works, O Lord! Thy thoughts are very deep.
A senseless man has no knowledge; Nor does a stupid man understand this:
That when the wicked sprouted up like grass, And all who did iniquity flourished, It [was only] that they might be destroyed forevermore.
But Thou, O Lord, art on high forever.
For, behold, Thine enemies, O Lord, For, behold, Thine enemies will perish; All who do iniquity will be scattered.
But Thou hast exalted my horn like [that of] the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.
And my eye has looked [exultantly] upon my foes, My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me.
The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Planted in the house of the Lord, They will flourish in the courts of our God.
They will still yield fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and very green,
To declare that the Lord is upright; [He is] my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
