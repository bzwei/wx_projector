O Lord, God of vengeance; God of vengeance, shine forth!
Rise up, O Judge of the earth; Render recompense to the proud.
How long shall the wicked, O Lord, How long shall the wicked exult?
They pour forth [words], they speak arrogantly; All who do wickedness vaunt themselves.
They crush Thy people, O Lord, And afflict Thy heritage.
They slay the widow and the stranger, And murder the orphans.
And they have said, "The Lord does not see, Nor does the God of Jacob pay heed."
Pay heed, you senseless among the people; And when will you understand, stupid ones?
He who planted the ear, does He not hear? He who formed the eye, does He not see?
He who chastens the nations, will He not rebuke, [Even] He who teaches man knowledge?
The Lord knows the thoughts of man, That they are a [mere] breath.
Blessed is the man whom Thou dost chasten, O Lord, And dost teach out of Thy law;
That Thou mayest grant him relief from the days of adversity, Until a pit is dug for the wicked.
For the Lord will not abandon His people, Nor will He forsake His inheritance.
For judgment will again be righteous; And all the upright in heart will follow it.
Who will stand up for me against evildoers? Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness?
If the Lord had not been my help, My soul would soon have dwelt in [the abode of] silence.
If I should say, "My foot has slipped," Thy lovingkindness, O Lord, will hold me up.
When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Thy consolations delight my soul.
Can a throne of destruction be allied with Thee, One which devises mischief by decree?
They band themselves together against the life of the righteous, And condemn the innocent to death.
But the Lord has been my stronghold, And my God the rock of my refuge.
And He has brought back their wickedness upon them, And will destroy them in their evil; The Lord our God will destroy them.
