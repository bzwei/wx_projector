Not to us, O Lord, not to us, But to Thy name give glory Because of Thy lovingkindness, because of Thy truth.
Why should the nations say, "Where, now, is their God?"
But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.
Their idols are silver and gold, The work of man's hands.
They have mouths, but they cannot speak; They have eyes, but they cannot see;
They have ears, but they cannot hear; They have noses, but they cannot smell;
They have hands, but they cannot feel; They have feet, but they cannot walk; They cannot make a sound with their throat.
Those who make them will become like them, Everyone who trusts in them.
O Israel, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield.
You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield.
The Lord has been mindful of us; He will bless [us]; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless those who fear the Lord, The small together with the great.
May the Lord give you increase, You and your children.
May you be blessed of the Lord, Maker of heaven and earth.
The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; But the earth He has given to the sons of men.
The dead do not praise the Lord, Nor [do] any who go down into silence;
But as for us, we will bless the Lord From this time forth and forever. Praise the Lord!
