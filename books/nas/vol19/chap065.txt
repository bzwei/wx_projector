(For the choir director. A Psalm of David. A Song.) There will be silence before Thee, [and] praise in Zion, O God; And to Thee the vow will be performed.
O Thou who dost hear prayer, To Thee all men come.
Iniquities prevail against me; As for our transgressions, Thou dost forgive them.
How blessed is the one whom Thou dost choose, and bring near [to Thee], To dwell in Thy courts. We will be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, Thy holy temple.
By awesome [deeds] Thou dost answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, Thou who art the trust of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest sea;
Who dost establish the mountains by His strength, Being girded with might;
Who dost still the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples.
And they who dwell in the ends [of the earth] stand in awe of Thy signs; Thou dost make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy.
Thou dost visit the earth, and cause it to overflow; Thou dost greatly enrich it; The stream of God is full of water; Thou dost prepare their grain, for thus Thou dost prepare the earth.
Thou dost water its furrows abundantly; Thou dost settle its ridges; Thou dost soften it with showers; Thou dost bless its growth.
Thou hast crowned the year with Thy bounty, And Thy paths drip [with] fatness.
The pastures of the wilderness drip, And the hills gird themselves with rejoicing.
The meadows are clothed with flocks, And the valleys are covered with grain; They shout for joy, yes, they sing.
