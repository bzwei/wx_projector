(For the choir director. A Maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told) (Saul, and said to him, "David has come to the house of Ahimelech.") Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God [endures] all day long.
Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, O worker of deceit.
You love evil more than good, Falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah.
You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.
But God will break you down forever; He will snatch you up, and tear you away from [your] tent, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah.
And the righteous will see and fear, And will laugh at him, [saying,]
"Behold, the man who would not make God his refuge, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, [And] was strong in his [evil] desire."
But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever.
I will give Thee thanks forever, because Thou hast done [it], And I will wait on Thy name, for [it is] good, in the presence of Thy godly ones.
