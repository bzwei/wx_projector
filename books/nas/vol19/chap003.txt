(A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.) O Lord, how my adversaries have increased! Many are rising up against me.
Many are saying of my soul, "There is no deliverance for him in God." Selah.
But Thou, O Lord, art a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.
I was crying to the Lord with my voice, And He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah.
I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustains me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me round about.
Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God! For Thou hast smitten all my enemies on the cheek; Thou hast shattered the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation belongs to the Lord; Thy blessing [be] upon Thy people! Selah.
