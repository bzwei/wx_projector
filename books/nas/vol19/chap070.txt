(For the choir director. [A Psalm] of David; for a memorial.) O God, [hasten] to deliver me; O Lord, hasten to my help!
Let those be ashamed and humiliated Who seek my life; Let those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt.
Let those be turned back because of their shame Who say, "Aha, aha!"
Let all who seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; And let those who love Thy salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified."
But I am afflicted and needy; Hasten to me, O God! Thou art my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay.
