(A Mikhtam of David.) Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in Thee.
I said to the Lord, "Thou art my Lord; I have no good besides Thee."
As for the saints who are in the earth, They are the majestic ones in whom is all my delight.
The sorrows of those who have bartered for another [god] will be multiplied; I shall not pour out their libations of blood, Nor shall I take their names upon my lips.
The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; Thou dost support my lot.
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, my heritage is beautiful to me.
I will bless the Lord who has counseled me; Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.
I have set the Lord continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will dwell securely.
For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to Sheol; Neither wilt Thou allow Thy Holy One to undergo decay.
Thou wilt make known to me the path of life; In Thy presence is fulness of joy; In Thy right hand there are pleasures forever.
