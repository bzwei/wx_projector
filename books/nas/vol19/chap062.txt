(For the choir director; according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.) My soul [waits] in silence for God only; From Him is my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.
How long will you assail a man, That you may murder [him,] all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
They have counseled only to thrust him down from his high position; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouth, But inwardly they curse. Selah.
My soul, wait in silence for God only, For my hope is from Him.
He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
On God my salvation and my glory [rest]; The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.
Trust in Him at all times, O people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.
Men of low degree are only vanity, and men of rank are a lie; In the balances they go up; They are together lighter than breath.
Do not trust in oppression, And do not vainly hope in robbery; If riches increase, do not set [your] heart [upon them.]
Once God has spoken; Twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God;
And lovingkindness is Thine, O Lord, For Thou dost recompense a man according to his work.
