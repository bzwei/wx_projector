(For the choir director; according to Jonath elem rehokim. A Mikhtam of David,) (when the Philistines seized him in Gath.) Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled upon me; Fighting all day long he oppresses me.
My foes have trampled upon me all day long, For they are many who fight proudly against me.
When I am afraid, I will put my trust in Thee.
In God, whose word I praise, In God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can [mere] man do to me?
All day long they distort my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.
They attack, they lurk, They watch my steps, As they have waited [to take] my life.
Because of wickedness, cast them forth, In anger put down the peoples, O God!
Thou hast taken account of my wanderings; Put my tears in Thy bottle; Are [they] not in Thy book?
Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call; This I know, that God is for me.
In God, [whose] word I praise, In the Lord, [whose] word I praise,
In God I have put my trust, I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?
Thy vows are [binding] upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to Thee.
For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, Indeed my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the living.
