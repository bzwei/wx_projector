(For the choir director. A Psalm of David.) May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob set you [securely] on high!
May He send you help from the sanctuary, And support you from Zion!
May He remember all your meal offerings, And find your burnt offering acceptable! Selah.
May He grant you your heart's desire, And fulfill all your counsel!
We will sing for joy over your victory, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners. May the Lord fulfill all your petitions.
Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven, With the saving strength of His right hand.
Some [boast] in chariots, and some in horses; But we will boast in the name of the Lord, our God.
They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stood upright.
Save, O Lord; May the King answer us in the day we call.
