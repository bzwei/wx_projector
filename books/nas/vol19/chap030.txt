(A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House. [A Psalm] of David.) I will extol Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast lifted me up, And hast not let my enemies rejoice over me.
O Lord my God, I cried to Thee for help, and Thou didst heal me.
O Lord, Thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
Sing praise to the Lord, you His godly ones, And give thanks to His holy name.
For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, But a shout of joy [comes] in the morning.
Now as for me, I said in my prosperity, "I will never be moved."
O Lord, by Thy favor Thou hast made my mountain to stand strong; Thou didst hide Thy face, I was dismayed.
To Thee, O Lord, I called, And to the Lord I made supplication:
"What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise Thee? Will it declare Thy faithfulness?
"Hear, O Lord, and be gracious to me; O Lord, be Thou my helper."
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; Thou hast loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness;
That [my] soul may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to Thee forever.
