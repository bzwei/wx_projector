Why dost Thou stand afar off, O Lord? Why dost Thou hide [Thyself] in times of trouble?
In pride the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted; Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.
For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, And the greedy man curses [and] spurns the Lord.
The wicked, in the haughtiness of his countenance, does not seek [Him.] All his thoughts are, "There is no God."
His ways prosper at all times; Thy judgments are on high, out of his sight; As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.
He says to himself, "I shall not be moved; Throughout all generations I shall not be in adversity."
His mouth is full of curses and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is mischief and wickedness.
He sits in the lurking places of the villages; In the hiding places he kills the innocent; His eyes stealthily watch for the unfortunate.
He lurks in a hiding place as a lion in his lair; He lurks to catch the afflicted; He catches the afflicted when he draws him into his net.
He crouches, he bows down, And the unfortunate fall by his mighty ones.
He says to himself, "God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see it."
Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up Thy hand. Do not forget the afflicted.
Why has the wicked spurned God? He has said to himself, "Thou wilt not require [it]."
Thou hast seen [it], for Thou hast beheld mischief and vexation to take it into Thy hand. The unfortunate commits [himself] to Thee; Thou hast been the helper of the orphan.
Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer, Seek out his wickedness until Thou dost find none.
The Lord is King forever and ever; Nations have perished from His land.
O Lord, Thou hast heard the desire of the humble; Thou wilt strengthen their heart, Thou wilt incline Thine ear
To vindicate the orphan and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may cause terror no more.
