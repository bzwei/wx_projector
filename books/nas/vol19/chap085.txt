(For the choir director. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.) O Lord, Thou didst show favor to Thy land; Thou didst restore the captivity of Jacob.
Thou didst forgive the iniquity of Thy people; Thou didst cover all their sin. Selah.
Thou didst withdraw all Thy fury; Thou didst turn away from Thy burning anger.
Restore us, O God of our salvation, And cause Thine indignation toward us to cease.
Wilt Thou be angry with us forever? Wilt Thou prolong Thine anger to all generations?
Wilt Thou not Thyself revive us again, That Thy people may rejoice in Thee?
Show us Thy lovingkindness, O Lord, And grant us Thy salvation.
I will hear what God the Lord will say; For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones; But let them not turn back to folly.
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, That glory may dwell in our land.
Lovingkindness and truth have met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth springs from the earth; And righteousness looks down from heaven.
Indeed, the Lord will give what is good; And our land will yield its produce.
Righteousness will go before Him, And will make His footsteps into a way.
