(A Song of Ascents, of David.) "Had it not been the Lord who was on our side," Let Israel now say,
"Had it not been the Lord who was on our side, When men rose up against us;
Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their anger was kindled against us;
Then the waters would have engulfed us, The stream would have swept over our soul;
Then the raging waters would have swept over our soul. "
Blessed be the Lord, Who has not given us to be torn by their teeth.
Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the trapper; The snare is broken and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.
