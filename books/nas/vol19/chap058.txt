(For the choir director; [set to] Al-tashheth. A Mikhtam of David.) Do you indeed speak righteousness, O gods? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?
No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.
They have venom like the venom of a serpent; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear,
So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, [Or] a skillful caster of spells.
O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; Break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord.
Let them flow away like water that runs off; [When] he aims his arrows, let them be as headless shafts.
[Let them be] as a snail which melts away as it goes along, [Like] the miscarriages of a woman which never see the sun.
Before your pots can feel [the fire of] thorns, He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
And men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; Surely there is a God who judges on earth!"
