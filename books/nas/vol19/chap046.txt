(For the choir director. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah, set to Alamoth. A Song.) God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.
Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change, And though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea;
Though its waters roar [and] foam, Though the mountains quake at its swelling pride. Selah.
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, The holy dwelling places of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.
The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered; He raised His voice, the earth melted.
The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.
Come, behold the works of the Lord, Who has wrought desolations in the earth.
He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire.
"Cease [striving] and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth."
The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.
