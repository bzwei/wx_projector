(A Song of Ascents, of David.) Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, [Even] Aaron's beard, Coming down upon the edge of his robes.
It is like the dew of Hermon, Coming down upon the mountains of Zion; For there the Lord commanded the blessing-- life forever.
