(A Prayer of David.) Incline Thine ear, O Lord, [and] answer me; For I am afflicted and needy.
Do preserve my soul, for I am a godly man; O Thou my God, save Thy servant who trusts in Thee.
Be gracious to me, O Lord, For to Thee I cry all day long.
Make glad the soul of Thy servant, For to Thee, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
For Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon Thee.
Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; And give heed to the voice of my supplications!
In the day of my trouble I shall call upon Thee, For Thou wilt answer me.
There is no one like Thee among the gods, O Lord; Nor are there any works like Thine.
All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, O Lord; And they shall glorify Thy name.
For Thou art great and doest wondrous deeds; Thou alone art God.
Teach me Thy way, O Lord; I will walk in Thy truth; Unite my heart to fear Thy name.
I will give thanks to Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And will glorify Thy name forever.
For Thy lovingkindness toward me is great, And Thou hast delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
O God, arrogant men have risen up against me, And a band of violent men have sought my life, And they have not set Thee before them.
But Thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.
Turn to me, and be gracious to me; Oh grant Thy strength to Thy servant, And save the son of Thy handmaid.
Show me a sign for good, That those who hate me may see [it], and be ashamed, Because Thou, O Lord, hast helped me and comforted me.
