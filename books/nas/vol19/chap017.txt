(A Prayer of David.) Hear a just cause, O Lord, give heed to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips.
Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence; Let Thine eyes look with equity.
Thou hast tried my heart; Thou hast visited [me] by night; Thou hast tested me and dost find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.
As for the deeds of men, by the word of Thy lips I have kept from the paths of the violent.
My steps have held fast to Thy paths. My feet have not slipped.
I have called upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God; Incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.
Wondrously show Thy lovingkindness, O Savior of those who take refuge at Thy right hand From those who rise up [against them].
Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,
From the wicked who despoil me, My deadly enemies, who surround me.
They have closed their unfeeling [heart]; With their mouth they speak proudly.
They have now surrounded us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast [us] down to the ground.
He is like a lion that is eager to tear, And as a young lion lurking in hiding places.
Arise, O Lord, confront him, bring him low; Deliver my soul from the wicked with Thy sword,
From men with Thy hand, O Lord, From men of the world, whose portion is in [this] life; And whose belly Thou dost fill with Thy treasure; They are satisfied with children, And leave their abundance to their babes.
As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness; I will be satisfied with Thy likeness when I awake.
