(For the choir director, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.) I said, "I will guard my ways, That I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle, While the wicked are in my presence."
I was dumb and silent, I refrained [even] from good; And my sorrow grew worse.
My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned; [Then] I spoke with my tongue:
"Lord, make me to know my end, And what is the extent of my days, Let me know how transient I am.
"Behold, Thou hast made my days [as] handbreadths, And my lifetime as nothing in Thy sight, Surely every man at his best is a mere breath. Selah.
"Surely every man walks about as a phantom; Surely they make an uproar for nothing; He amasses [riches], and does not know who will gather them.
"And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in Thee.
"Deliver me from all my transgressions; Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
"I have become dumb, I do not open my mouth, Because it is Thou who hast done [it.]
"Remove Thy plague from me; Because of the opposition of Thy hand, I am perishing.
"With reproofs Thou dost chasten a man for iniquity; Thou dost consume as a moth what is precious to him; Surely every man is a mere breath. Selah.
"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with Thee, A sojourner like all my fathers.
"Turn Thy gaze away from me, that I may smile [again], Before I depart and am no more."
