(A Psalm for Thanksgiving.) Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth.
Serve the Lord with gladness; Come before Him with joyful singing.
Know that the Lord Himself is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; [We are] His people and the sheep of His pasture.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving, [And] His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him; bless His name.
For the Lord is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting, And His faithfulness to all generations.
