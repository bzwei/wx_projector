(Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer.) I cry aloud with my voice to the Lord; I make supplication with my voice to the Lord.
I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare my trouble before Him.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou didst know my path. In the way where I walk They have hidden a trap for me.
Look to the right and see; For there is no one who regards me; There is no escape for me; No one cares for my soul.
I cried out to Thee, O Lord; I said, "Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
"Give heed to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for me.
"Bring my soul out of prison, So that I may give thanks to Thy name; The righteous will surround me, For Thou wilt deal bountifully with me."
