(For the choir director. A Psalm of David.) Rescue me, O Lord, from evil men; Preserve me from violent men,
Who devise evil things in [their] hearts; They continually stir up wars.
They sharpen their tongues as a serpent; Poison of a viper is under their lips. Selah.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men, Who have purposed to trip up my feet.
The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set snares for me. Selah.
I said to the Lord, "Thou art my God; Give ear, O Lord, to the voice of my supplications.
"O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
"Do not grant, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; Do not promote his [evil] device, [lest] they be exalted. Selah.
"As for the head of those who surround me, May the mischief of their lips cover them.
"May burning coals fall upon them; May they be cast into the fire, Into deep pits from which they cannot rise.
"May a slanderer not be established in the earth; May evil hunt the violent man speedily."
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the poor.
Surely the righteous will give thanks to Thy name; The upright will dwell in Thy presence.
