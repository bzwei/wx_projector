Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!
For Thou art the God of my strength; why hast Thou rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
O send out Thy light and Thy truth, let them lead me; Let them bring me to Thy holy hill, And to Thy dwelling places.
Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And upon the lyre I shall praise Thee, O God, my God.
Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him, The help of my countenance, and my God.
