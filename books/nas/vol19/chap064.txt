(For the choir director. A Psalm of David.) Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; Preserve my life from dread of the enemy.
Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, From the tumult of those who do iniquity,
Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword. They aimed bitter speech [as] their arrow,
To shoot from concealment at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear.
They hold fast to themselves an evil purpose; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who can see them?"
They devise injustices, [saying,] "We are ready with a well-conceived plot"; For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep.
But God will shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they will be wounded.
So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against them; All who see them will shake the head.
Then all men will fear, And will declare the work of God, And will consider what He has done.
The righteous man will be glad in the Lord, and will take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart will glory.
