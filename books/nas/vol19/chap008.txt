(For the choir director; on the Gittith. A Psalm of David.) O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Thy name in all the earth, Who hast displayed Thy splendor above the heavens!
From the mouth of infants and nursing babes Thou hast established strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To make the enemy and the revengeful cease.
When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained;
What is man, that Thou dost take thought of him? And the son of man, that Thou dost care for him?
Yet Thou hast made him a little lower than God, And dost crown him with glory and majesty!
Thou dost make him to rule over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet,
All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field,
The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
O Lord, our Lord, How majestic is Thy name in all the earth!
