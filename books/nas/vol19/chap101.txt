(A Psalm of David.) I will sing of lovingkindness and justice, To Thee, O Lord, I will sing praises.
I will give heed to the blameless way. When wilt Thou come to me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.
I will set no worthless thing before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It shall not fasten its grip on me.
A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil.
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will destroy; No one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I endure.
My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; He who walks in a blameless way is the one who will minister to me.
He who practices deceit shall not dwell within my house; He who speaks falsehood shall not maintain his position before me.
Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, So as to cut off from the city of the Lord all those who do iniquity.
