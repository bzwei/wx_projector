(For the choir director; on a stringed instrument. [A Psalm] of David.) Hear my cry, O God; Give heed to my prayer.
From the end of the earth I call to Thee, when my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
For Thou hast been a refuge for me, A tower of strength against the enemy.
Let me dwell in Thy tent forever; Let me take refuge in the shelter of Thy wings. Selah.
For Thou hast heard my vows, O God; Thou hast given [me] the inheritance of those who fear Thy name.
Thou wilt prolong the king's life; His years will be as many generations.
He will abide before God forever; Appoint lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
So I will sing praise to Thy name forever, That I may pay my vows day by day.
