But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God; Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
Sing to God, sing praises to His name; Lift up [a song] for Him who rides through the deserts, Whose name is the Lord, and exult before Him.
A father of the fatherless and a judge for the widows, Is God in His holy habitation.

O God, when Thou didst go forth before Thy people, When Thou didst march through the wilderness, Selah.
The earth quaked; The heavens also dropped [rain] at the presence of God; Sinai itself [quaked] at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
Thou didst shed abroad a plentiful rain, O God; Thou didst confirm Thine inheritance, when it was parched.
Thy creatures settled in it; Thou didst provide in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.
The Lord gives the command; The women who proclaim the [good] tidings are a great host:
"Kings of armies flee, they flee, And she who remains at home will divide the spoil!"
When you lie down among the sheepfolds, [You are like] the wings of a dove covered with silver, And its pinions with glistening gold.
When the Almighty scattered the kings there, It was snowing in Zalmon.
A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; A mountain [of many] peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
Why do you look with envy, O mountains with [many] peaks, At the mountain which God has desired for His abode? Surely, the Lord will dwell [there] forever.
The chariots of God are myriads, thousands upon thousands; The Lord is among them [as at] Sinai, in holiness.
Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captive [Thy] captives; Thou hast received gifts among men, Even [among] the rebellious also, that the Lord God may dwell [there.]
Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden, The God [who] is our salvation. Selah.
God is to us a God of deliverances; And to God the Lord belong escapes from death.
Surely God will shatter the head of His enemies, The hairy crown of him who goes on in his guilty deeds.
The Lord said, "I will bring [them] back from Bashan. I will bring [them] back from the depths of the sea;
That your foot may shatter [them] in blood, The tongue of your dogs [may have] its portion from [your] enemies. "

The singers went on, the musicians after [them], In the midst of the maidens beating tambourines.

There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them, The princes of Judah [in] their throng, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
Your God has commanded your strength; Show Thyself strong, O God, who hast acted on our behalf.
Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem Kings will bring gifts to Thee.
Rebuke the beasts in the reeds, The herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver; He has scattered the peoples who delight in war.
Envoys will come out of Egypt; Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God.
Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; Sing praises to the Lord, Selah.
To Him who rides upon the highest heavens, which are from ancient times; Behold, He speaks forth with His voice, a mighty voice.
Ascribe strength to God; His majesty is over Israel, And His strength is in the skies.
O God, [Thou art] awesome from Thy sanctuary. The God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to the people. Blessed be God!
