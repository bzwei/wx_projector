(For the choir director; [set to] El Shoshannim; Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph.) Oh, give ear, Shepherd of Israel, Thou who dost lead Joseph like a flock; Thou who art enthroned [above] the cherubim, shine forth!
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Thy power, And come to save us!
O God, restore us, And cause Thy face to shine [upon us], and we will be saved.
O Lord God [of] hosts, How long wilt Thou be angry with the prayer of Thy people?
Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And Thou hast made them to drink tears in large measure.
Thou dost make us an object of contention to our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.
O God [of] hosts, restore us, And cause Thy face to shine [upon us,] and we will be saved.
Thou didst remove a vine from Egypt; Thou didst drive out the nations, and didst plant it.
Thou didst clear [the ground] before it, And it took deep root and filled the land.
The mountains were covered with its shadow; And the cedars of God with its boughs.
It was sending out its branches to the sea, And its shoots to the River.
Why hast Thou broken down its hedges, So that all who pass [that] way pick its [fruit]?
A boar from the forest eats it away, And whatever moves in the field feeds on it.
O God [of] hosts, turn again now, we beseech Thee; Look down from heaven and see, and take care of this vine,
Even the shoot which Thy right hand has planted, And on the son whom Thou hast strengthened for Thyself.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance.
Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom Thou didst make strong for Thyself.
Then we shall not turn back from Thee; Revive us, and we will call upon Thy name.
O Lord God of hosts, restore us; Cause Thy face to shine [upon us,] and we will be saved.
