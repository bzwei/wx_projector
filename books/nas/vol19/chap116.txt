I love the Lord, because He hears My voice [and] my supplications.
Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I shall call [upon Him] as long as I live.
The cords of death encompassed me, And the terrors of Sheol came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.
Then I called upon the name of the Lord: "O Lord, I beseech Thee, save my life!"
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; Yes, our God is compassionate.
The Lord preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.
Return to your rest, O my soul, For the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.
For Thou hast rescued my soul from death, My eyes from tears, My feet from stumbling.
I shall walk before the Lord In the land of the living.
I believed when I said, "I am greatly afflicted."
I said in my alarm, "All men are liars."
What shall I render to the Lord For all His benefits toward me?
I shall lift up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the Lord.
I shall pay my vows to the Lord, Oh [may it be] in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of His godly ones.
O Lord, surely I am Thy servant, I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast loosed my bonds.
To Thee I shall offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving, And call upon the name of the Lord.
I shall pay my vows to the Lord, Oh [may it be] in the presence of all His people,
In the courts of the Lord's house, In the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
