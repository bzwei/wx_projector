(A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.) Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, His holy mountain.
Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion [in] the far north, The city of the great King.
God, in her palaces, Has made Himself known as a stronghold.
For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.
They saw [it], then they were amazed; They were terrified, they fled in alarm.
Panic seized them there, Anguish, as of a woman in childbirth.
With the east wind Thou dost break the ships of Tarshish.
As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish her forever. Selah.
We have thought on Thy lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of Thy temple.
As is Thy name, O God, So is Thy praise to the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let Mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of Thy judgments.
Walk about Zion, and go around her; Count her towers;
Consider her ramparts; Go through her palaces; That you may tell [it] to the next generation.
For such is God, Our God forever and ever; He will guide us until death.
