(For the choir director; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.) Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! Thou hast relieved me in my distress; Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
O sons of men, how long will my honor become a reproach? [How long] will you love what is worthless and aim at deception? Selah.
But know that the Lord has set apart the godly man for Himself; The Lord hears when I call to Him.
Tremble, and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the Lord.
Many are saying, "Who will show us [any] good?" Lift up the light of Thy countenance upon us, O Lord!
Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine abound.
In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For Thou alone, O Lord, dost make me to dwell in safety.
