([A Psalm] of David.) To Thee, O Lord, I call; My rock, do not be deaf to me, Lest, if Thou be silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to Thee for help, When I lift up my hands toward Thy holy sanctuary.
Do not drag me away with the wicked And with those who work iniquity; Who speak peace with their neighbors, While evil is in their hearts.
Requite them according to their work and according to the evil of their practices; Requite them according to the deeds of their hands; Repay them their recompense.
Because they do not regard the works of the Lord Nor the deeds of His hands, He will tear them down and not build them up.
Blessed be the Lord, Because He has heard the voice of my supplication.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I shall thank Him.
The Lord is their strength, And He is a saving defense to His anointed.
Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; Be their shepherd also, and carry them forever.
