Then He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!"
And as He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard [Him] speaking to me.
Then He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.
"And I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children; and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God.'
"As for them, whether they listen or not-- for they are a rebellious house-- they will know that a prophet has been among them.
"And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house.
"But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious.
"Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you."
Then I looked, behold, a hand was extended to me; and lo, a scroll [was] in it.
When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back; and written on it were lamentations, mourning and woe.
