After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested [Himself] in this way.
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples.
Simon Peter *said to them, "I am going fishing." They *said to him, "We will also come with you." They went out, and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.
But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
Jesus therefore *said to them, "Children, you do not have any fish, do you?" They answered Him, "No."
And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you will find [a catch]." They cast therefore, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.
That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, "It is the Lord." And so when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped [for work]), and threw himself into the sea.
But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net [full] of fish.
And so when they got out upon the land, they *saw a charcoal fire [already] laid, and fish placed on it, and bread.
Jesus *said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have now caught."
Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.
Jesus *said to them, "Come [and] have breakfast." None of the disciples ventured to question Him, "Who are You?" knowing that it was the Lord.
Jesus *came and *took the bread, and *gave them, and the fish likewise.
This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead.
So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, "Simon, [son] of John, do you love Me more than these?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Tend My lambs."
He *said to him again a second time, "Simon, [son] of John, do you love Me?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Shepherd My sheep."
He *said to him the third time, "Simon, [son] of John, do you love Me?" Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, "Do you love Me?" And he said to Him," Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You. "Jesus *said to him," Tend My sheep.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself, and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will gird you, and bring you where you do not wish to [go."]
Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He *said to him, "Follow Me!"
Peter, turning around, *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following [them;] the one who also had leaned back on His breast at the supper, and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?"
Peter therefore seeing him *said to Jesus, "Lord, and what about this man?"
Jesus *said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what [is that] to you? You follow Me!"
This saying therefore went out among the brethren that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but [only,] "If I want him to remain until I come, what [is that] to you?"
This is the disciple who bears witness of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his witness is true.
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they *were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself *would not contain the books which *were written.
