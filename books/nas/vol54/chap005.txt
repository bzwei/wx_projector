Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but [rather] appeal to [him] as a father, [to] the younger men as brothers,
the older women as mothers, [and] the younger women as sisters, in all purity.
Honor widows who are widows indeed;
but if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family, and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
Now she who is a widow indeed, and who has been left alone has fixed her hope on God, and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.
But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives.
Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach.
But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
Let a widow be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, [having been] the wife of one man,
having a reputation for good works; [and] if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has assisted those in distress, [and] if she has devoted herself to every good work.
But refuse [to put] younger widows [on the list], for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married,
[thus] incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge.
And at the same time they also learn [to be] idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper [to mention.]
Therefore, I want younger [widows] to get married, bear children, keep house, [and] give the enemy no occasion for reproach;
for some have already turned aside to follow Satan.
If any woman who is a believer has [dependent] widows, let her assist them, and let not the church be burdened, so that it may assist those who are widows indeed.
Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.
For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing," and "The laborer is worthy of his wages."
Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.
Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful [of sinning.]
I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of [His] chosen angels, to maintain these [principles] without bias, doing nothing in a [spirit of] partiality.
Do not lay hands upon anyone [too] hastily and thus share [responsibility for] the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin.
No longer drink water [exclusively,] but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their [sins] follow after.
Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
