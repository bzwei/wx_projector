Brethren, even if a man is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; [each one] looking to yourself, lest you too be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ.
For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have [reason for] boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another.
For each one shall bear his own load.
And let the one who is taught the word share all good things with him who teaches.
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.
For the one who sows to his own flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit shall from the Spirit reap eternal life.
And let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we shall reap if we do not grow weary.
So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.
See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.
Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
But may it never be that I should boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy [be] upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
