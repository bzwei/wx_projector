"I am the rose of Sharon, The lily of the valleys."
"Like a lily among the thorns, So is my darling among the maidens."
"Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I took great delight and sat down, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
"He has brought me to [his] banquet hall, And his banner over me is love.
"Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, Because I am lovesick.
"[Let] his left hand be under my head And his right hand embrace me."
"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, That you will not arouse or awaken [my] love, Until she pleases."
"Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills!
"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice.
"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along.
'For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over [and] gone.
'The flowers have [already] appeared in the land; The time has arrived for pruning [the vines,] And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land.
'The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth [their] fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along!' "
"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the secret place of the steep pathway, Let me see your form, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely."
"Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards, While our vineyards are in blossom."
"My beloved is mine, and I am his; He pastures [his flock] among the lilies.
"Until the cool of the day when the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag on the mountains of Bether."
