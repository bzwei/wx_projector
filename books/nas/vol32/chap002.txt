Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish,
and he said, "I called out of my distress to the Lord, And He answered me. I cried for help from the depth of Sheol; Thou didst hear my voice.
"For Thou hadst cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the current engulfed me. All Thy breakers and billows passed over me.
"So I said, 'I have been expelled from Thy sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Thy holy temple.'
"Water encompassed me to the point of death. The great deep engulfed me, Weeds were wrapped around my head.
"I descended to the roots of the mountains. The earth with its bars [was] around me forever, But Thou hast brought up my life from the pit, O Lord my God.
"While I was fainting away, I remembered the Lord; And my prayer came to Thee, Into Thy holy temple.
"Those who regard vain idols Forsake their faithfulness,
But I will sacrifice to Thee With the voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the Lord. "
Then the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land.
