Let not many [of you] become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we shall incur a stricter judgment.
For we all stumble in many [ways.] If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.
Now if we put the bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us, we direct their entire body as well.
Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder, wherever the inclination of the pilot desires.
So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and [yet] it boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!
And the tongue is a fire, the [very] world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of [our] life, and is set on fire by hell.
For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the human race.
But no one can tame the tongue; [it is] a restless evil [and] full of deadly poison.
With it we bless [our] Lord and Father; and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God;
from the same mouth come [both] blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.
Does a fountain send out from the same opening [both] fresh and bitter [water]?
Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Neither [can] salt water produce fresh.
Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and [so] lie against the truth.
This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.
But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.
And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
