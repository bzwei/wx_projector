Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, So honor is not fitting for a fool.
Like a sparrow in [its] flitting, like a swallow in [its] flying, So a curse without cause does not alight.
A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the back of fools.
Do not answer a fool according to his folly, Lest you also be like him.
Answer a fool as his folly [deserves], Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
He cuts off [his own] feet, [and] drinks violence Who sends a message by the hand of a fool.
[Like] the legs [which] hang down from the lame, So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
Like one who binds a stone in a sling, So is he who gives honor to a fool.
[Like] a thorn [which] falls into the hand of a drunkard, So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
[Like] an archer who wounds everyone, So is he who hires a fool or who hires those who pass by.
Like a dog that returns to its vomit Is a fool who repeats his folly.
Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road! A lion is in the open square!"
[As] the door turns on its hinges, So [does] the sluggard on his bed.
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; He is weary of bringing it to his mouth again.
The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes Than seven men who can give a discreet answer.
[Like] one who takes a dog by the ears Is he who passes by [and] meddles with strife not belonging to him.
Like a madman who throws Firebrands, arrows and death,
So is the man who deceives his neighbor, And says, "Was I not joking?"
For lack of wood the fire goes out, And where there is no whisperer, contention quiets down.
[Like] charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to kindle strife.
The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts of the body.
[Like] an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross Are burning lips and a wicked heart.
He who hates disguises [it] with his lips, But he lays up deceit in his heart.
When he speaks graciously, do not believe him, For there are seven abominations in his heart.
[Though his] hatred covers itself with guile, His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.
He who digs a pit will fall into it, And he who rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
A lying tongue hates those it crushes, And a flattering mouth works ruin.
