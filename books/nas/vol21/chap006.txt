There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men--
a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires, but God has not empowered him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction.
If a man fathers a hundred [children] and lives many years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things, and he does not even have a [proper] burial, [then] I say, "Better the miscarriage than he,
for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity.
"It never sees the sun and it never knows [anything;] it is better off than he.
"Even if the [other] man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things-- do not all go to one place?"
All a man's labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied.
For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? What [advantage] does the poor man have, knowing [how] to walk before the living?
What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind.
Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is.
For there are many words which increase futility. What [then] is the advantage to a man?
For who knows what is good for a man during [his] lifetime, [during] the few years of his futile life? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
