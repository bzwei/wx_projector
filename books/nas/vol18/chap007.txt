"Is not man forced to labor on earth, And [are not] his days like the days of a hired man?
"As a slave who pants for the shade, And as a hired man who eagerly waits for his wages,
So am I allotted months of vanity, And nights of trouble are appointed me.
"When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night continues, And I am continually tossing until dawn.
"My flesh is clothed with worms and a crust of dirt; My skin hardens and runs.
"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And come to an end without hope.
"Remember that my life is [but] breath, My eye will not again see good.
"The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; Thine eyes [will be] on me, but I will not be.
"When a cloud vanishes, it is gone, So he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.
"He will not return again to his house, Nor will his place know him anymore.
"Therefore, I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
"Am I the sea, or the sea monster, That Thou dost set a guard over me?
"If I say, 'My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,'
Then Thou dost frighten me with dreams And terrify me by visions;
So that my soul would choose suffocation, Death rather than my pains.
"I waste away; I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are [but] a breath.
"What is man that Thou dost magnify him, And that Thou art concerned about him,
That Thou dost examine him every morning, And try him every moment?
"Wilt Thou never turn Thy gaze away from me, Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle?
"Have I sinned? What have I done to Thee, O watcher of men? Why hast Thou set me as Thy target, So that I am a burden to myself?
"Why then dost Thou not pardon my transgression And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust; And Thou wilt seek me, but I will not be."
