"My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, The grave is [ready] for me.
"Surely mockers are with me, And my eye gazes on their provocation.
"Lay down, now, a pledge for me with Thyself; Who is there that will be my guarantor?
"For Thou hast kept their heart from understanding; Therefore Thou wilt not exalt [them.]
"He who informs against friends for a share [of the spoil,] The eyes of his children also shall languish.
"But He has made me a byword of the people, And I am one at whom men spit.
"My eye has also grown dim because of grief, And all my members are as a shadow.
"The upright shall be appalled at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
"Nevertheless the righteous shall hold to his way, And he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.
"But come again all of you now, For I do not find a wise man among you.
"My days are past, my plans are torn apart, [Even] the wishes of my heart.
"They make night into day, [saying,] 'The light is near,' in the presence of darkness.
"If I look for Sheol as my home, I make my bed in the darkness;
If I call to the pit,' You are my father'; To the worm,' my mother and my sister';
Where now is my hope? And who regards my hope?
"Will it go down with me to Sheol? Shall we together go down into the dust?"
