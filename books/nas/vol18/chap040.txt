Then the Lord said to Job,
"Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who reproves God answer it."
Then Job answered the Lord and said,
"Behold, I am insignificant; what can I reply to Thee? I lay my hand on my mouth.
"Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; Even twice, and I will add no more."
Then the Lord answered Job out of the storm, and said,
"Now gird up your loins like a man; I will ask you, and you instruct Me.
"Will you really annul My judgment? Will you condemn Me that you may be justified?
"Or do you have an arm like God, And can you thunder with a voice like His?
"Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity; And clothe yourself with honor and majesty.
"Pour out the overflowings of your anger; And look on everyone who is proud, and make him low.
"Look on everyone who is proud, [and] humble him; And tread down the wicked where they stand.
"Hide them in the dust together; Bind them in the hidden [place.]
"Then I will also confess to you, That your own right hand can save you.
"Behold now, Behemoth, which I made as well as you; He eats grass like an ox.
"Behold now, his strength in his loins, And his power in the muscles of his belly.
"He bends his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
"His bones are tubes of bronze; His limbs are like bars of iron.
"He is the first of the ways of God; Let his maker bring near his sword.
"Surely the mountains bring him food, And all the beasts of the field play there.
"Under the lotus plants he lies down, In the covert of the reeds and the marsh.
"The lotus plants cover him with shade; The willows of the brook surround him.
"If a river rages, he is not alarmed; He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth.
"Can anyone capture him when he is on watch, With barbs can anyone pierce [his] nose?
