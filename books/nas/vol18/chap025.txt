"Dominion and awe belong to Him Who establishes peace in His heights.
"Is there any number to His troops? And upon whom does His light not rise?
"How then can a man be just with God? Or how can he be clean who is born of woman?
"If even the moon has no brightness And the stars are not pure in His sight,
How much less man, [that] maggot, And the son of man, [that] worm! "
