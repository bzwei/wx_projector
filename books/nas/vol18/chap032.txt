Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram burned; against Job his anger burned, because he justified himself before God.
And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he.
And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned.
So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said, "I am young in years and you are old; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think.
"I thought age should speak, And increased years should teach wisdom.
"But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.
"The abundant [in years] may not be wise, Nor may elders understand justice.
"So I say, 'Listen to me, I too will tell what I think.'
"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, While you pondered what to say.
"I even paid close attention to you, Indeed, there was no one who refuted Job, Not one of you who answered his words.
"Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; God will rout him, not man.'
"For he has not arranged [his] words against me; Nor will I reply to him with your arguments.
"They are dismayed, they answer no more; Words have failed them.
"And shall I wait, because they do not speak, Because they stop [and] answer no more?
"I too will answer my share, I also will tell my opinion.
"For I am full of words; The spirit within me constrains me.
"Behold, my belly is like unvented wine, Like new wineskins it is about to burst.
"Let me speak that I may get relief; Let me open my lips and answer.
"Let me now be partial to no one; Nor flatter [any] man.
"For I do not know how to flatter, [Else] my Maker would soon take me away.
