"Man, who is born of woman, Is short-lived and full of turmoil.
"Like a flower he comes forth and withers. He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.
"Thou also dost open Thine eyes on him, And bring him into judgment with Thyself.
"Who can make the clean out of the unclean? No one!
"Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with Thee, And his limits Thou hast set so that he cannot pass.
"Turn Thy gaze from him that he may rest, Until he fulfills his day like a hired man.
"For there is hope for a tree, When it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not fail.
"Though its roots grow old in the ground, And its stump dies in the dry soil,
At the scent of water it will flourish And put forth sprigs like a plant.
"But man dies and lies prostrate. Man expires, and where is he?
"[As] water evaporates from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dried up,
So man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens be no more, He will not awake nor be aroused out of his sleep.
"Oh that Thou wouldst hide me in Sheol, That Thou wouldst conceal me until Thy wrath returns [to Thee,] That Thou wouldst set a limit for me and remember me!
"If a man dies, will he live [again?] All the days of my struggle I will wait, Until my change comes.
"Thou wilt call, and I will answer Thee; Thou wilt long for the work of Thy hands.
"For now Thou dost number my steps, Thou dost not observe my sin.
"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And Thou dost wrap up my iniquity.
"But the falling mountain crumbles away, And the rock moves from its place;
Water wears away stones, Its torrents wash away the dust of the earth; So Thou dost destroy man's hope.
"Thou dost forever overpower him and he departs; [Thou] dost change his appearance and send him away.
"His sons achieve honor, but he does not know [it;] Or they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.
"But his body pains him, And he mourns only for himself."
