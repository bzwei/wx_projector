Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations! For you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved [harlots'] earnings on every threshing floor.
Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them, And the new wine will fail them.
They will not remain in the Lord's land, But Ephraim will return to Egypt, And in Assyria they will eat unclean [food.]
They will not pour out libations of wine to the Lord, Their sacrifices will not please Him. [Their bread will be] like mourners' bread; All who eat of it will be defiled, For their bread will be for themselves [alone]; It will not enter the house of the Lord.
What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the Lord?
For behold, they will go because of destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns [will be] in their tents.
The days of punishment have come, The days of retribution have come; Let Israel know [this]! The prophet is a fool, The inspired man is demented, Because of the grossness of your iniquity, And [because] your hostility is [so] great.
Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God, a prophet; [Yet] the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways, [And] there is [only] hostility in the house of his God.
They have gone deep in depravity As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins.
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first [season.] [But] they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame, And they became as detestable as that which they loved.
As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception!
Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them until not a man is left. Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them!
Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter.
Give them, O Lord-- what wilt Thou give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
All their evil is at Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will love them no more; All their princes are rebels.
Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they bear children, I will slay the precious ones of their womb.
My God will cast them away Because they have not listened to Him; And they will be wanderers among the nations.
