Then the Lord said to me, "Go again, love a woman [who] is loved by [her] husband, yet an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
So I bought her for myself for fifteen [shekels] of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
Then I said to her, "You shall stay with me for many days. You shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man; so I will also be toward you."
For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or [sacred] pillar, and without ephod or household idols.
Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness in the last days.
