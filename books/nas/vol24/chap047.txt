That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh conquered Gaza.
Thus says the Lord: "Behold, waters are going to rise from the north And become an overflowing torrent, And overflow the land and all its fulness, The city and those who live in it; And the men will cry out, And every inhabitant of the land will wail.
"Because of the noise of the galloping hoofs of his stallions, The tumult of his chariots, [and] the rumbling of his wheels, The fathers have not turned back for [their] children, Because of the limpness of [their] hands,
On account of the day that is coming To destroy all the Philistines, To cut off from Tyre and Sidon Every ally that is left; For the Lord is going to destroy the Philistines, The remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
"Baldness has come upon Gaza; Ashkelon has been ruined. O remnant of their valley, How long will you gash yourself?
"Ah, sword of the Lord, How long will you not be quiet? Withdraw into your sheath; Be at rest and stay still.
"How can it be quiet, When the Lord has given it an order? Against Ashkelon and against the seacoast-- There He has assigned it."
