God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,
in these last days has spoken to us in [His] Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.
And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high;
having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.
For to which of the angels did He ever say, "Thou art My Son, Today I have begotten Thee"? And again, "I will be a Father to Him And He shall be a Son to Me"?
And when He again brings the first-born into the world, He says, " And let all the angels of God worship Him."
And of the angels He says, "Who makes His angels winds, And His ministers a flame of fire."
But of the Son [He says], "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever, And the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.
"Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee With the oil of gladness above Thy companions."
And, "Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the works of Thy hands;
They will perish, but Thou remainest; And they all will become old as a garment,
And as a mantle Thou wilt roll them up; As a garment they will also be changed. But Thou art the same, And Thy years will not come to an end. "
But to which of the angels has He ever said, "Sit at My right hand, Until I make Thine enemies  A footstool for Thy feet "?
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
