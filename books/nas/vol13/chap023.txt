Now when David reached old age, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel with the priests and the Levites.
And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward, and their number by census of men was 38,000.
Of these, 24,000 were to oversee the work of the house of the Lord; and 6,000 [were] officers and judges,
and 4,000 [were] gatekeepers, and 4,000 [were] praising the Lord with the instruments which David made for giving praise.
And David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Of the Gershonites [were] Ladan and Shimei.
The sons of Ladan [were] Jehiel the first and Zetham and Joel, three.
The sons of Shimei [were] Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' [households] of Ladan.
And the sons of Shimei [were] Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four [were] the sons of Shimei.
And Jahath was the first, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they became a father's household, one class.
The sons of Kohath were four: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart to sanctify him as most holy, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister to Him and to bless in His name forever.
But [as for] Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
The sons of Moses [were] Gershom and Eliezer.
The son of Gershom [was] Shebuel the chief.
And the son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
The son of Izhar was Shelomith the chief.
The sons of Hebron [were] Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
The sons of Uzziel [were] Micah the first and Isshiah the second.
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli [were] Eleazar and Kish.
And Eleazar died and had no sons, but daughters only, so their brothers, the sons of Kish, took them [as wives.]
The sons of Mushi [were] three: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.
These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers' households, [even] the heads of the fathers' [households] of those of them who were counted, in the number of names by their census, doing the work for the service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward.
For David said, "The Lord God of Israel has given rest to His people, and He dwells in Jerusalem forever.
"And also, the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its utensils for its service."
For by the last words of David the sons of Levi [were] numbered, from twenty years old and upward.
For their office is to assist the sons of Aaron with the service of the house of the Lord, in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God,
and with the showbread, and the fine flour for a grain offering, and unleavened wafers, or [what is baked in] the pan, or what is well-mixed, and all measures of volume and size.
And they are to stand every morning to thank and to praise the Lord, and likewise at evening,
and to offer all burnt offerings to the Lord, on the sabbaths, the new moons and the fixed festivals in the number [set] by the ordinance concerning them, continually before the Lord.
Thus they are to keep charge of the tent of meeting, and charge of the holy place, and charge of the sons of Aaron their relatives, for the service of the house of the Lord.
